# Project Title

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Cyper Security become more an more important. Large companies are able to provide an own security team. But even so there is always a risk to be hacked. More and more systems are online and in case of critical infrastructure a cyber attact can have huge impact for a company, a city or even a country. At moment cyper security is mostly reactive. You install tools, monitor the results if you have security operation center and you start to harden and improve your environment. It is a little bit that everybody build his own securtiy-castle but there is little proactive help from goverment. It would be very helpful if the goverment can provide help by proactive protection against cyber criminals oder cyber spys at least for critical infrastructure.
A few month ago a huge power black out in spain and portugal happend. A cyper attact was a possible reason even so it was denied afterwards.

## Background


There a couple of problems a goverment driven cyber protection could solve
* Outage of critical infrastructure
* Finding and bann cyper criminals, combats and spys to lower the risk
* Analyse successful hacks and look for possible solutions to avoid repetition
  


## How is it used?

This problem is not an easy small project you can solve by your own, like a simple spam filter.
Most companies have securtiy tools like firewalls, gateways, intrusion prevention or detection systems. This systems provide a tons of log files to handle and protocol IT security. A the moment it is more like every company fight for his own. It would be great to have community to collect all the logs centrally and try to find potential new risks, new protection method or even neutralize the bad players in the IT environment. To avoid misuse of the data a goverment organisation like in germany the BSI [BSI([https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Home/home_node.html)]
could be a candidate for data collection. The data could also be used for research project or product development given a working data protection.

## Data sources and AI methods
The data pool would be filled by the participating companies and organisations continuously. A normalisation of the data like intrusion detection systems typically to would help to organize the data.

This would be great data source to find pattern, analyse successful and unsuccessful attacs and establish a central risk mitigation and risk alert system. The data pool could also be very helpful for universities for reseach topics.

## Challenges

Cyper crime a part of hybrid war tactis need tools in time to defend your company, country or critical infrastructure. Without AI i assume it is not possible to handle the amount of data and find the right conclusions.

## What next?

I am a member of a political party and will discuss the topic with my colleagues.

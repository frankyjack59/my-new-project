# Project Title

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Cybersecurity is becoming increasingly important. Large companies often have their own security teams, but the risk of being hacked still remains. As more systems go online, a cyberattack on critical infrastructure can have devastating consequences for a company, a city, or even a country. Currently, cybersecurity is mostly reactive. Tools are installed, results are monitored through a security operations center, and environments are hardened over time. It's as if everyone is building their own security castle, yet there is little proactive assistance from the government. Government support in providing proactive protection against cybercriminals or cyber spies, especially for critical infrastructure, would be invaluable. A few months ago, a massive power blackout occurred in Spain and Portugal, with a cyberattack being considered a potential cause, though it was later denied.

## Background

There are several issues that government-driven cyber protection could address:
* Outages of critical infrastructure
* Identifying and banning cybercriminals, combatants, and spies to reduce risks
* Analyzing successful hacks and finding solutions to prevent recurrence

## How is it used?

This issue is not a simple project that can be tackled individually, like creating a basic spam filter. Most companies already use security tools such as firewalls, gateways, and intrusion prevention or detection systems. These systems generate an overwhelming amount of log files to manage and document IT security. Currently, it feels like every company is fighting on its own. A collective effort to centralize log data and identify new potential risks would be incredibly beneficial. To avoid misuse of the data a goverment organisation like in germany the BSI [BSI([https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Home/home_node.html)]
could be a candidate for data collection. The data could also be used for research project or product development given a working data protection.

## Data sources and AI methods
The data pool would be continuously populated by participating companies and organizations. Normalizing the data, similar to how intrusion detection systems operate, would help to organize it effectively.

This could serve as a valuable resource for identifying patterns, analyzing successful and unsuccessful attacks, and establishing a centralized risk mitigation and alert system. The data pool could also be incredibly useful for universities working on research topics.

## Challenges

Cybercrime, as part of hybrid warfare tactics, requires timely tools to defend companies, countries, and critical infrastructure. Without AI, it seems nearly impossible to manage the volume of data and draw accurate conclusions.

## What next?

As a member of a political party, I plan to discuss this topic with my colleagues.
